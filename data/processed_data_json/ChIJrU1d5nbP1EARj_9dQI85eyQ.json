      "text": "The Motherland Monument in Kiev is a monumental sculpture that is the central object of the memorial complex of the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in World War II. The unique statue, which rises on the Pecherskaya Hills on the right bank of the Dnieper River, is viewed from almost anywhere in the city. It became the calling card of modern Kiev and was among the ten highest monuments of the planet.\nThe grand opening of the Motherland in the entire museum complex took place on May 9, 1981. General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party L. Brezhnev took direct part in the ceremony.\nThe height of the Motherland monument is 62 meters. The height of the cone pedestal is 40 meters. The all-welded statue weighs almost 500 tons. The main frame is 20 meters deep.The size of the shield is 8 meters by 12 meters. The height of the sword is 16 meters.\nThe structure has two elevators – an inclined angle of 75 degrees and a vertical elevator terminating at the head of the statue. They are used to lift visitors to observation decks, but above all for the maintenance of the Motherland.Another must visit if you are in Kyiv. The Motherland Monument towers over the city and really is a symbol of independence / resistance that many Ukrainians are proud of.\n\nThe park around the monument of free of charge to walk around and is very well kept. There are also a number of tanks on display , and for a small fee you can pay to visit the WWII museum next to the park. I am told the museum is very interesting but was closed during our visit due to the air raid siren going off.Standing proudly over the Kiev skyline is the 340-foot tall, stainless steel Soviet Mother Motherland statue.\nOriginally intended to be even taller, the sword of the statue was cut because it was higher than the cross of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra - renowned Orthodox Christian Monastery. She ranks 18th on the list of the world’s tallest statues and for example a bit of comparison, The Statue of Liberty ranks about 42nd.",
