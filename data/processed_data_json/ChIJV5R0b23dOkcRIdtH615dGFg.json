The energy of the place was amazing—calm, powerful, and full of history.\n\nThe beautiful architecture and peaceful atmosphere made it a special place to reflect. It was exciting to see how our culture and faith have remained strong here for so many years. If you're in Lviv, this church is definitely worth visiting!",

It is located in the heart of Old Town and is s perfect place for a walk, taking a picture or two and/or just sitting down inside to contemplate about life. I highly recommend it as a must see point of interest while in that city.",
