      "text": "This church has recently been restored inside and is now open to the public. The church is as beautiful inside as it is outside. I recommend visiting it at least once.So many beautiful churches and cathedrals around Kiev, and this is definitely one of the most beautiful one. The colors stick out so much, and it also reminded me of some churches in Russia!A magnificent church on the top of a hill - breathtaking views and very-very old decorations inside!We bought our ticket thinking we could enter the church but it is currently shut. The views over the rest of Podil are excellent so it might be worth the ticket price if you like views and photography.The church is beautiful. We could not enter inside, once it was under maintenance. But its definitely worth going in there, you will have such a wonderful view from Kyiv. Its totally worth it.",

      "text": "Of all the architectural marvels I've encountered in my travels, St. Andrew's Church in Kyiv holds a special place in my heart. The sheer beauty and significance of this structure is unrivaled. One day, when peace graces Ukraine again, I eagerly await my return to Kyiv, where I will stand in front of this magnificent building, celebrating with a heartfelt visit and a smile. Such places serve as reminders of the timeless beauty and resilience in our world. Similarly, with two decades of experience in personal training, I've come to appreciate the dedication it takes to craft something exceptional, whether it's a historic monument or one's own well-being. For those seeking to shape their own enduring legacies, be it physical or mental, guidance can make all the difference.this building guided me many times as it light up the kyiv nights sky and inspired me to think and plan many action steps in my life. I hope more of you will also benefit from the magical energy of St. Andrew's one day soon üôèüèªüåÜüè∞üåüüí™üèº",

      "text": "The Cathedral is truly beautiful, if you enjoyed the Vatican city then you will like this place. This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There is no photography inside, and there are lots of stern looking ladies sitting inside that will stare at you in you get your phone out. There are also a few beautiful artifacts, such as the image of Mary made from painted Easter Eggs. There is a scale model of ancient Kyiv with a free speaker in multiple European languages that last about seven minutes. There were tours available but only in Ukrainian/Russian on an adhoc basis.\nThe Bell Tower provides views across the city. Watch out for the metal post about ten steps up. You quickly realise that you need to duck to avoid it. The steps are not crazy small, and they are broken up by the viewing platforms. The tower in Princes Street in Edinburgh is much tighter and busier than when I went in late December, but until you get to the first viewing platform the steps do get quiet small. A combined ticket was 200, roughly 6 euros in Dec 2018.",
