      "text": "I did not think that I would have to give such an assessment to the beautiful cathedral, but the situation that has developed is very, very unpleasant.\nMy mother and I entered the cathedral on the morning of April 21, walked 10 meters as we were \"asked\" to exit. We asked in quotation marks, because we were literally rudely kicked out by a woman who, as it turned out, works in the cathedral.\nIt was very strange. A woman with a short haircut, wearing a white shirt, a gray skirt and a red tie came up to us with my mother, ordered and very rudely said \"get out of here!\", we were surprised, because there were other people next to us (it was near the benches, where there were also people), but the woman said this only to us. We were very surprised, so we decided to ask again, she repeated \"he! the exit is there!\", we were even more surprised and shouted \"why?\", to which we heard the answer \"because you don't know how to kneel and pray!\"\nHow do you like it? We spent literally 30 seconds in the cathedral, when this lady came to such a conclusion and decided that she could expel us. It is also not clear what kind of new rule this is, that a person who did not immediately kneel down must go away. What was it in general and how to understand it?\nWe went around all the temples of Lviv, I have been to many shrines in Europe in 40 countries, and for the first time in my life I come across such a thing in the temple of God. With such undisguised rudeness on equal ground. Is it Christian? And what about people with a prosthesis? Are tourists also kicked out? People, what is this? \"Because you don't know how to stand on your knees\", I still can't get away from it... the impression remains for a long time.",

But there is an inadequate woman working here, who in the middle of our excursion ran up and started kicking me out of the cathedral because of a 2kg maltipoo in her arms (a dog). She shouted, insulted me and then called someone on the street and slandered us even more. Although the dog sat calmly in my arms. By the way, in other cathedrals, we were allowed in calmly. It is very strange that someone can shout insults and kick a person out of a holy place)",
