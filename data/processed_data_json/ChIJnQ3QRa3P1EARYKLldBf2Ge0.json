      "text": "The palace is very modern as it has been restored many times in the past 100 years. Apart from minor details, None of the interior, furniture, lighting is old, and there are no historical artifacts. There is some art, but it’s unremarkable and some authors not known. It’s beautiful but there is no “historical spirit” inside. It is a functioning presidential reception where official ceremonies are held, and many foreign dignitaries have been here. The palace is small inside and the available area for visitors is even smaller, the tour will take up to 1 hour. Worth a visit but nothing special.",

Nevertheless, also lots of military and police walking around and parking green defence jeeps near.. But all in all very peaceful and worth visiting!",
