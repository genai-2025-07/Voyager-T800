It's centrally located but quiet. Close to Golden Gate, walking distance to Maidan and even St. Andrew's church. Lots of restaurants and cafes around.\nStaff were polite. Price was very good. I didn't give 5 stars as bathroom needed little bit better cleaning, but overall I can say that we were happy with this hotel and would stay there again.",

But rooms are clean, workers are polite and helpful, just one problem - some of their rooms are downstairs and they have no restaurant or normal eating place. Most I was impressed about workers honesty, because everybody everywhere in Kiev just tries to cheat and earn money from you. So, if you are searching for the place to sleep, it is really good. If you expect more service as spa and so on, you must look for another place.",
