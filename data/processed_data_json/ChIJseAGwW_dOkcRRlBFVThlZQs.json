      "text": "Lviv is a very conservative city that has sacrificed its soul to tourism. Don't expect to find \"non-conformist\" places, \"degenerate\" creative spaces (like in Kyiv or Odessa) or have a chance to attend post-punk or electro-punk concerts. The underground subversive avant-garde in Lviv is absent. \"Modern\" art in Lviv is mostly when an antique shop window hasn't been restored since 1912: it's \"urban patina\", but shh, don't say it too loudly, for fear that it becomes trendy!",
