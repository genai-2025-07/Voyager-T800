On a sunny day the golden roof really is glistening in the sun and the blue walls stand out prominently against the greyness of the surrounding area. Outside the surrounding wall there‚Äôs a nice square where you can sit and watch the world go by, including on my visit a photo shoot for a wedding, with loads of impressive and other ornate buildings. There was a number of locals selling stuff outside the entrance in the wall but fortunately they weren‚Äôt bothersome at all so don‚Äôt let it put you off.\n\nOnce within the walls there‚Äôs a real sense of calm. There‚Äôs plenty of benches to sit and a nice walk around the grounds. There‚Äôs some other old buildings next to the main cathedral and a small ‚Äòorchard‚Äô which is pleasant in the sun.\n\nUnfortunately I didn‚Äôt have time to venture inside the main cathedral but despite that it was well worth checking out and it‚Äôs no wonder that it‚Äôs one of the cities main sights.",
