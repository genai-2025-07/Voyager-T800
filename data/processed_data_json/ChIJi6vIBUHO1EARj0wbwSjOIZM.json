      "text": "The Kyiv Funicular was a great experience! It didn’t take much time to enter, and everything was well-organized. The ride was smooth, and the funicular was very clean. The best part was the amazing view as it went up. You can take great photos, especially if you stand next to the window facing the river—the scenery is stunning!\n\nWhen you arrive at the top, there is a board displaying the history of the funicular, which is interesting to read. The area also has a big park where you can walk and visit beautiful churches. Along the way, artists and painters perform live, adding a vibrant and energetic atmosphere to the experience. It’s a must-visit spot in Kyiv!",

I've added a couple of views of the waterfront area across the road opposite and if you head left at the top station there is a lovely park with more great views over the river",
