      "text": "So freaking cool. Even the grounds around this place are beautiful.\nPlaques explained everything in English and Ukrainian. Apparently you can climb inside the helicopter but it was closed for Corona. ☹️\n\nLotta sad stories coming out of the conflict near Donetsk. Was very sad to see how many Ukrainian soldiers have died. There's a small exhibit of cars that have come from that region where the recent conflict is and has been.\n\nGo and considering paying the entrance fee to the war II area to support best place. Seriously one of the coolest museums.",

Quite a bit of walking will be required. This place is wheelchair friendly.\n\nIf you love military photogtaphy this is the place to take ur camera to. Tanks, planes and soldier status can be foubd here. Most of the meuseum is open air so be watchful of the weather. Good for a couple of hours visit.",
