      "text": "Good attraction to visit when in Kyiv.\nThe animals look in good condition and relatively secure.\nRecommend to visit with children.Visited today and very depressing, animals locked up probably due to the cold weather but they were pacing And showing signs they were very unhappy. Elephant and tigers probably the worst for wear . Only been to two zoos in my life and Kiev zoo was way better than London zoo. This was the mains attraction for my stay in Kiev albeit unexpectedly . Was unsure about going was expecting it to be old. However there a lot of work going on to get the zoo update. The animals seem well look after. It a great place to walk round it bigger than I thought and lots of things to do. It old in some places but you can see they working on it. Overall it a good city zoo and they are being educational I was impressed with it and can't wait to return.",

But we have visited during the winter time so thats why I thınk it wasnt the best times for some animals . So you can easyly get ticket there , adults is 250 grivna . And it took our 2 hour visiting here.  I liked tigers and lions . Elephant place was small for him. That was upseting me . So you can visit here especially summer or spring time . There is parkings nearby also . İts at the center of kiev so easy to reach",

      "text": "The compact territory contains a very diverse collection of animals. I was impressed by the almost perfect conditions in which the animals are dwelling. Primates have their own islands with houses and trees. There is a vast array of reptiles, including many species of turtles, snakes, lizards, and alligators. The area also hosts spectacular mammals such as giraffes, elephants, tigers, lions, and even the opportunity to contemplate huge gorillas and multiple chimpanzees. Additionally, there are elegant birds like flamingos, ravens, and birds of prey.\nIt is possible to buy special food for feeding sheep and goats for just a few euros. Near one deep pond, you can also purchase feed for colorful and large koi carps (fishes).",

Visitors can enjoy seeing a variety of fascinating creatures, from majestic big cats to playful primates. The zoo is undergoing renovations to improve the enclosures and provide a better habitat for the animals.\nWhile some reviews mention outdated enclosures, others commend the zoo's efforts in modernization. If you're looking for a spacious zoo with a wide range of animals, Kyiv Zoo is a good option. However, if you're concerned about animal welfare, it might be best to research the zoo's current conditions before your visit.",
