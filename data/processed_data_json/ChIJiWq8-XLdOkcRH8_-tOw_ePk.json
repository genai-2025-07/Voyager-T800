      "text": "A beautiful and historic opera house, with an ornate marble interior, a classic theatre with balconies, and the only 'sloping' stage I have ever seen. They put on high quality operas, with very professional casts and costumes even in wartime. Of course almost all of them are in Ukrainian or Italian, but it's still worth a visit for the experience. The price is around 500-600 UAH for a seat in the 'stalls'. If it's a midweek performance you can usually get a ticket just before the show from the box office, no need to book online.",
