The 'Pharmacy Museum' (drugsrore-mesuem) in Lviv, Ukraine, was opened in 1966 in the building of an old drugstore at the corner of the Market Square. It is the working drugstore and museum (two in one), the oldest of the existing pharmacies in Lviv. The museum consists of 16 rooms which exhibit antique pharmaceutical appliances, prescriptions, medicines, dishes, a library of pharmacy-related books, and even a reconstructed alchemy workshop.
