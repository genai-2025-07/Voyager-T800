== History ==

In the spring of 1966, a Department of Folk Construction was established within the , marking the beginning of the work on creating an open-air museum. In 1971, the department was reorganized into the Museum of Folk Architecture and Rural Life, which officially opened to visitors in 1972. The idea of establishing such a museum belonged to the renowned Ukrainian scholar Ilarion Sventsitsky, who had initiated the concept of an open-air museum—similar to the Skansen in Stockholm — as early as the late 1920s.

In the 1920s, when the community of the village of Kryvka decided to dismantle their old wooden Church of St. Nicholas (built in 1761) after the construction of a new one, the Ukrainian art historian and researcher of ancient Ukrainian art, Mykhailo Dragan, with the assistance of the local parish priest Markelii Kunovsky, managed to persuade the villagers to postpone its demolition. Thanks to subsequent efforts by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky and his brother, the Blessed Klymentiy Sheptytsky, the church was dismantled under the supervision and direction of Mykhailo Dragan in 1930, transported to Lviv, and reassembled as a church for the needs of the Studite monastery. It became the first exhibit of what would later become the museum.In 1966, at the initiative of employees of the Museum of Ethnography and Arts and Crafts, preparations for a new open-air museum began. A Department of Folk Construction was established, and in 1971, it was reorganized into the Museum of Folk Architecture and Rural Life. In 1975, Petro Kharytonovych Pyrozhenko worked at the museum for a year. He organized expeditions in search of exhibits throughout the Pre-Carpathian and Podolia regions.

In 2013, the museum received a UNESCO grant of $300,000. As part of a two-year program, the funding was allocated for seminars and demand analysis, enhancement of tourism appeal, and the study of international museum practices. The program also included funding for advertising, and for purchasing specialized equipment for the architectural department and collections storage. Planned renovations included workshops, the administrative building, storage facilities, and a traditional house from the village of Shandrovets. Uniforms for the museum staff were also planned.

On December 1, 2016, the museum was officially named after the Blessed Klymentiy Sheptytsky. From that point forward, the skansen, long known to Lviv residents as "Shevchenkivskyi Hai," became formally titled the Klymentiy Sheptytsky Museum of Folk Architecture and Rural Life. Notably, the name "Shevchenkivskyi Hai" has never held official status.

In late July 2018, the museum administration announced a tender for the construction of an information and educational center in the southern part of the museum grounds, on Chernecha Hora Street—along the extension of the main alley of Znesinnia Park and adjacent to the city transport and pedestrian routes of Nizhynska and Striletska Streets. The proposed one-story building was to include an entrance hall, restrooms, and a café for 80 visitors. The basement level was to house classrooms, a conference hall for 110 people, as well as administrative and utility rooms. Construction was expected to be completed by the end of 2018. In August 2017, a parking lot with 53 spaces was already under construction near the future visitor center site. On September 29, 2024, an information and educational center with a shelter was opened in the park.

== Museum Exhibition ==
The museum's collection includes 124 architectural monuments, organized into 54 homesteads. The museum houses four exhibition halls, two of which feature permanent exhibitions. In the permanent exhibitions and museum storage facilities, there are approximately 20,000 items of everyday life and applied folk art.

The 36-hectare museum territory is conventionally divided into six ethnographic zones. Each zone functions as a miniature village composed of 15–20 monuments of vernacular architecture. Within the residential and utility buildings are displays of household items, agricultural tools, means of transportation, and craft equipment. The six mini-villages are named Boykivshchyna, Lemkivshchyna, Hutsulshchyna, Bukovyna, Podillia, and Lvivshchyna, although the latter three are less frequently visited by tourists, as they are considered to be less informative.

Among the 120+ architectural monuments from the western regions of Ukraine, six are wooden churches. The oldest exhibit is a peasant house from 1749. Other notable buildings include a blacksmith's forge, a school, a sawmill, a fulling mill, a watermill, and a windmill. The Museum of Folk Architecture and Life in Lviv is visited by over 300 thousand people every year.

=== Boykivshchyna ===
Significant exhibits in the Boykivshchyna section include a rural homestead with a house built in 1812 and a stable from 1903, both relocated from the village of Lybohora in the Turka Raion, as well as a Boyko house from 1909 originating from the village of Tukholka in the Skole Raion. This section also contains two churches.

A masterpiece of folk architecture is the wooden Church of St. Nicholas from 1763, relocated from the village of Kryvka in the Turka Raion — a monument of both national and European significance. The second church is from the village of Tysovets in the Skole Raion, dating to 1863.

=== Lemkivshchyna ===
The main exhibit in the Lemkivshchyna section is a peasant homestead from the Transcarpathian village of Zabrid. It is a traditional accompanied by auxiliary agricultural buildings, including a granary with a cellar, a chicken coop, a sekes, and a well. The house itself consists of a living room, an entrance hall, a pantry, a barn, and a threshing barn.

In 1992, this section was expanded through the efforts of patrons with a replica of the Church of Saints Volodymyr and Olha (1831), originally from the village of Kotań.

=== Hutsulshchyna ===
The central exhibit in the Hutsulshchyna section is a traditional Hutsul hrazhda — a fortified farmstead — from the village of Kryvorivnia in the Ivano-Frankivsk region.

=== Bukovina ===
The Bukovina section features several notable exhibits, including an early 20th-century homestead from the village of Berezhonka and the Church of the Holy Trinity (1774), which was relocated to the museum in the 1960s from the Kliokuchka area.

=== Lvivshchyna ===
A Roman Catholic chapel (also referred to as a "kostelyk") built in 1936–1937 in the village of Yazlivchyk, Brody Raion, is a key exhibit of the Lvivshchyna sector. In the autumn of 2012, the chapel was dismantled by a group of Polish students led by Professor Romana Cielątkowska, head of the Department of Ecological Design at Gdańsk University of Technology, and transported to Lviv. In the summer of 2013, Polish restorers reassembled the chapel at the Museum of Folk Architecture and Rural Life named after Klymentiy Sheptytsky. Today, this Roman Catholic chapel is one of the most striking examples of the now-rare group of wooden Catholic churches in Lviv Region from the first half of the 20th century. It is a unique instance of Art Nouveau style applied to wooden sacred architecture and has no analogues in Ukraine.
