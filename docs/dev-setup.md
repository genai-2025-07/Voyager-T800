## Installing Cursor IDE

I could not open the Cursor AppImage on my Kubuntu. The problem was that Cursor opens with sandbox by default. 
If you also struggle with opening the Cursor AppImage on Kubuntu, just ask ChatGPT how to create a .desktop file with --no-sandbox



## Connect it to your GitHub repo

No problem.



## Test LLM-assisted completion with a boilerplate prompt

1. I asked Cursor to create code to extract text from "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine" without using additional libraries like beautifulsoup4, and Cursor failed with it.
2. When Cursor uses additional libraries (beautifulsoup4), it does a better job.
3. It is EXTREMELY CONVENIENT to use TAB. I don't know how Cursor developers designed such a smart TAB. I just click on code where I want to make some changes and TAB immediately understands what I want to do. It's incredible.



## Tips

I use the Material Icon Theme Extension to distinguish between different files (it is convenient and beautiful).
