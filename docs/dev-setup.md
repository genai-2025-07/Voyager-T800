# Development Environment Setup: issue-1-17-setup-cursor-and-ai-dev-tools

## Task Summary
I set up my development environment with a GenAI-first mindset. I installed and configured Cursor IDE (an AI-assisted coding environment), integrated it with GitHub, and verified that basic AI assistance is available for code generation.

## What I Did

1. **Installed Cursor IDE (or Similar)**
   - Downloaded and installed [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.so/) on my system.
   - Followed the official installation instructions for my operating system.

2. **Connected to My GitHub Repository**
   - Opened Cursor IDE.
   - Used the built-in Git integration to connect to my GitHub account.
   - Cloned this repository and opened it in the IDE.

3. **Tested LLM-Assisted Completion**
   - Opened a code file in the project.
   - Typed a boilerplate prompt (e.g., "def hello_world():") and confirmed that AI-assisted code completion was working.
   - Also tested the AI assistant for code generation and explanations.
