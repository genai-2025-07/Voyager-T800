## Testing AI assistant on generating Python code
Previously created a 'test.py' file to evaluate how AI Assistant will work. After writing a single word 'class' it generated two magic methods '__init__' and '__str__' by scratch. By using different keyboard shortcuts it allows to quickly ask some questions or generate a code.
 - **Ctrl+K**: allows to ask small questions, generate code, edit selected code etc.;
 - **Ctrl+L**: sends your questions to chat;
 - **Tab**: accepts generated code;
